This is an upcoming mobile application with a mission to transform the way we commute. 
Its main objective is to enable carpooling, making travel more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. 
By linking drivers and passengers with similar routes, “The App” seeks to reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less traffic and lower carbon emissions.

Please note that the App is currently under development, and I am working tirelessly to provide you with a smooth carpooling experience soon. Stay tuned for updates!
